# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was using the camera to control the motors of the car. This is a crucial aspect of the self-driving car, since it needs to be able to track and recognize where the desired object is, and then respond accordingly through driving towards that object. At first, I encountered a problem in that the motors were wired incorrectly, leading to a forwards command becoming a right turn, for example. To solve this, I manually gave the robot some commands to test which connections corresponded with which wheels, and was able to fix the problem. The next step is to incorporate the ultrasonic sensors and integrate the electronics onto the chassis in such a way that the car can run on its own (separate from a monitor/wired power source).

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was assembling the chassis of the robotic car and attaching motors. Each of the four motors has two electrodes for connections, so I had to figure out the best way to wire them together. Since I'm using "tank steering", where rotating the wheels on one side faster makes the car turn, I chose to connect the two motors on each side of the car together first. One of the challenges that I faced was that the bottom screws on each motor were actually positioned too close to the acrylic chassis, making it impossible to rotate a nut to fasten them. To solve this, I reversed the direction of these bottom screws so that the nut would be positioned on the outside of the chassis. I've been able to use a battery to drive each of these motors individually, so the next step is to use a motor driver and the Raspberry Pi to control the motors using code.

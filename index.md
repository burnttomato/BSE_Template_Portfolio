# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone Example
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was assembling the chassis of the robotic car and attaching motors. Each of the four motors has two electrodes for connections, so I had to figure out the best way to wire them together. Since I'm using "tank steering", where rotating the wheels on one side faster makes the car turn, I chose to connect the two motors on each side of the car together first. One of the challenges that I faced was that the bottom screws on each motor were actually positioned too close to the acrylic chassis, making it impossible to rotate a nut to fasten them. To solve this, I reversed the direction of these bottom screws so that the nut would be positioned on the outside of the chassis. I've been able to use a battery to drive each of these motors individually, so the next step is to use a motor driver and the Raspberry Pi to control the motors using code.
